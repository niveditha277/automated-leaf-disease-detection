# Automated Leaf Disease Prediction

This project focuses on detecting and classifying leaf diseases using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Uses a **Deep Learning (DL) model** (`model.h5`) for prediction.
- Implements a **GUI-based approach** using Jupyter Notebook (`leaf_disease_gui_based_DL.ipynb`).
- Supports image input for disease classification.
- Outputs classification results and disease probability.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/niveditha277/automated-leaf-disease-prediction.git
